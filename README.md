# Banking-App
A program that takes input from two files: a customers file and a transactions file. It then displays the pending transactions, any invalid transactions, and the customers' balance following the valid transactions. 

Included are two customers files and two transactions files to run the program with. The second of both files has more input in order to test the program with larger files.
